;; Exercise 16.4
;;
;; Currently, the rule writer can introduce a new parameter without
;; defining it first. That is handy for rapid testing, but it means
;; that the user of the system won't be able to see a nice English
;; prompt, nor ask for the type of the parameter. In addition, if the
;; rule writer simply misspells a parameter, it will be treated as a
;; new one. Make a simple change to fix these problems.
;;

;; Parameter definitions allow for someone to see an English sentence
;; for a prompt and ask for the type of a parameter.
